## PEAK PERIOD ANALYSIS

### Introduction
In the month of september 2023, as business progressed, there was some uncertainty on the side of the inventory and production department as regards raw materials to be purchased and especially for the production department; when to produce, and in what quantity? This sometimes lead to dissatisfaction of customers when they come and products are sold out and also the organisation misses out on prospective sales opportunities. This analysis aimed to guide the inventory and production department especially and also, in some cases, the human resource team on which sales person should be on ground on which days depending on their strenghts.
### Basic goals of the project
* Accounting for sales revenue for each period of the day(morning, afternoon and night).
* Knowing the quantity of various products sold by each period of the day.
* Promo products sales performance.
  ### Actionable results:
* Came up with recomendations or a guide for the inventory department based on sales of certain items especially time-influenced ones such as perishables.
* Advise the production department to increase or reduce production of certain products at certain periods of time in order to increase sales and reduce wastage respectively.
* Informing and recommending to the branding and advertisinmg team based on the month's promo product perfomance.
### Data collection and data cleaning
Sales record for period analyzed was exported from the Point Of Sale(POS) software to a csv file. The cleaning process was done with excel; appropraitely attending to duplicates, missing values, unnecessary columns etc., checking validity of data and ensuring all columns had the right data type.
### Data Analysis and Vizualization
The analysis process was carried out using Structured query language(SQL). SQL queries was written to extract sales from stated periods of time as well as sales record of products during specific periods nof time. Basically using the WHERE clause and the LIKE operator alongside the wildcard character. Vizualization of this analysis was done using Excel.
